Using Python 3.7

To run the code, you need to download the files into one folder.
In the file 'code', you only need to run 'main.py'.

In the file 'Output', you'll get :
'encode_0.txt' - The first encoding (with LZW)
'encode_1.bin' - The second encoding (with Huffman)
'decode_0.bin' - The first decoding (with Huffman)
'decode_1.bin' - The last decoding (which is the file itself)
